    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a very easy, but elegant, baked chicken breast recipe that looks like you've spent hours in the kitchen when you've barely lifted a finger!
        </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 large bone-in chicken breast halves with skin</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and garlic; sprinkle with salt, black pepper, rosemary, and basil. Arrange chicken in a large baking dish and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast meat should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
